All notable changes to cv-witness are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versioning follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Versions before 0.4.0 were
developed in a private history that was purged when the repository went
public; their entries are consolidated summaries, not commit-for-commit notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Number fact gate (`scripts/check_cv_numbers.py`): after rendering, fail delivery when a CV number is backed by none of the approved source files (foundation.md, provenance.md, or per-application sources via repeatable `--source`). Years, single digits and alphanumeric-identifier fragments are skipped; wiring documented in SKILL.md step 6. Inspired by career-ops' generate-pdf fact gate.

### Changed

- CV tailoring now uses the latest candidate-approved CV as the default design baseline across authoring paths; redesigns require approval. PDF checking can assert private section landmarks in extracted order without logging their text. Builder headings use strict line matching to avoid body-text false positives.
- Replaced the README's flat file listing with a directory tree and purpose table; clarified prerequisites, configuration, delivery checks and completed-roadmap status.
- Retired completed implementation plans while retaining the user guides, test coverage and regeneration inputs.

### Fixed

- CSS escape sequences could disguise `@import` and `url()` from the renderer's resource preflight. The checker now decodes CSS escapes before rejecting resource-loading tokens, with regression coverage for escaped identifiers, functions and local-file imports.
- The README workflow preview now has an opaque light background and explicit dark labels, independent of the surrounding theme. Added standalone preview regeneration and rendering regressions.
- The CI browser smoke check uses the renderer's bounded startup deadline instead of a shorter cold-start limit; PDF validation remains required.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- Repeatable structured CV input and Engineering, Operations/Support, Research and Management ordering presets over one 10.5pt single-column layout.
- A4/Letter template gallery using fictional data; empty optional sections are omitted without fixed role slots or hidden content trimming.
- An animated export workflow and interactive public source map with three guided tours, compact mobile controls and regeneration helpers.
- Shared PDF delivery checks and automatic selected-posting overlap review before publishing a local render.
- Actual Chromium/Poppler failure-path tests on Linux and macOS, alongside the private corpus tests.
- Selected Obsidian Markdown imports with comment/embed/callout exclusions and conflicting-author protections.

### Fixed

- Handle macOS headless browsers that write a completed PDF but linger during shutdown, stopping only the owned render session before full PDF validation.
- Technical prose is no longer mistaken for CSS resource loading; layout-preserving extraction retains wrapped URL hyphens.
- Public diagram generation rejects forbidden tracked paths before reading content and stages all outputs before publication.
- Paper overrides no longer depend on one exact CSS string. Failed exports cannot replace an existing output; temporary browser profiles and HTML are cleaned up.
- Phrase reports show maximal runs and Unicode-aware metrics, omit private passages by default, and distinguish strict failure from review mode.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- Private, opt-in writing corpus with local Markdown/Cabinet, Sanity export, original-record and author-filtered message imports.
- Descriptive voice references, optional private excerpts, draft comparison and author-scoped deletion. No model training or live provider connector is included.
- Source revision handling, duplicate-text suppression, private-output protections and synthetic CLI tests on Linux/macOS with Python 3.11 and 3.14.

### Changed

- Refined the landing page with a fictional document preview, readable typography, responsive navigation and explicit product limitations.
- Added glass-inspired navigation and convection-inspired ambient motion with a soft fade into the sample section. Each page load starts with a fresh random arrangement; the lower sections have no lava effect.
- Added independently levitating chalk-style icons to the reading sections only, with motion controls and reduced-motion support. The header and footer have no chalk icons; the footer has a static bottom glow.
- Improved paragraph alignment, shortened the desktop subtitle, and added accessible command highlighting.
- Added smooth native FAQ expansion with an instant reduced-motion fallback.
- Added an Appearance panel with persistent settings, explicit transparency opt-in, accessibility fallbacks and pausing when hidden or offscreen.
- Unified section spacing on a responsive scale: 96px between desktop sections and 64px on narrow screens.
- Replaced the website mockup with an actual rendered sample PDF and screenshot, with fictional public source data and a reproduction command. The wider viewer has readable-size and fit-page modes.
- Simplified the README license footer to the MIT link.
- Grouped README badges by host, local tool and optional service; removed the employer-specific footer disclaimer.
- Shared one logo asset across the website and banner source.
- Used an explicit root-skill path in the Claude plugin manifest instead of recursive or resource-breaking links.

### Fixed

- Keyboard navigation and selected-state semantics for installation and example tabs.
- Clipboard feedback and recovery when automatic copying is denied or unavailable.
- Installation instructions that incorrectly chained Claude session commands as shell commands.
- Public claims that overstated automated enforcement, ATS compatibility and exact voice matching.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- No job-description mirroring gate: the posting informs emphasis and ordering only; CV wording stays in the candidate's voice.
- Candidate-voice rule: plain, specific, lightly warm; write-like-human discipline; voice-sample support planned.
- Private `provenance.md`: verification notes, external PR merge states, metrics bank, voice plan - separated from the master resume.
- Personal configuration section for portable paths (CV guide, applications log, output directory).
- ATS punctuation rules: no em/en dashes or smart quotes; plain hyphens in date ranges (documented top parsing failures).
- Deterministic banner: `assets/banner.html` rendered by headless Chrome; the wordmark is real type and cannot be misspelled.
- JD-overlap lint: `scripts/jd_overlap.py` flags CV phrasing shared with the posting.
- Claude Code plugin and marketplace manifests; Codex and AGENTS.md support.
- Repository renamed cv-forge → cv-witness (unique address); private history purged at publication.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- Amazon Quick native-flow documentation, verified against a real session.
- Merge-state verification: external PRs are checked via the GitHub API before being cited.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- Verified desktop and cross-platform evidence in the resume sources.
- Amazon Quick Desktop as the preferred authoring path.

### Fixed

- Bullet-marker clipping at the left edge.
- Vertical balance of the rendered page.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- ATS checklist and mechanical output verification (pdftotext extraction, one-page assertion, placeholder scan).
- First end-to-end tailored CV produced with the skill (Logitech QA internship).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09

### Added

- Initial skill: foundation-driven tailoring, single-column ATS-safe template, headless-Chrome renderer, anti-fabrication `[FILL: ...]` gate.
